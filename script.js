This project focuses on understanding the ionized gas component of the ISM in the disks of the nearby Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33) galaxies. The SIP interns will work with multi slit spectra obtained by the mentoring team using the DEIMOS instrument on the Keck II 10-m telescope. The interns will use Python spectroscopic data analysis techniques to detect and carry out a detailed characterization of the spectral emission lines associated with the ionized gas ISM component of these two galaxies, and draw conclusions about its rotational dynamics, chemical composition, and physical properties.")
